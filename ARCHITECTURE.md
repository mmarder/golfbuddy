# GolfBuddy — Architecture Reference

This document captures the complete state of the app as of 2026-07-02. Any developer or AI agent
should be able to read this file and have a full mental model **without exploring the codebase**.
Keeping it current is a deploy blocker.

---

## 1. Overview

GolfBuddy is a personal, mobile-first static site for learning golf. It holds club notes and
technique reminders captured from the owner's pro lessons across four practice areas (Fundamentals,
Long Game, Short Game, Putting), plus a **Daily Drills** checklist — a core-swing routine to run
every day. It is a static reference the owner opens on a phone at the range or on the green. No
backend, no user accounts, no personal data.

**Deployment:** GitHub Pages, built and deployed by the GitHub Actions workflow in
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (push to `main` → build with `withastro/action` → deploy to Pages).
Pages is enabled with Source = GitHub Actions.
**Live URL:** https://mmarder.github.io/golfbuddy/ (project Pages). Served from the `/golfbuddy`
subpath, so `astro.config.mjs` sets `base: '/golfbuddy'` and internal links go through
`withBase()` (`src/lib/paths.ts`).
**Custom domain (deferred):** `golf.mardr.com` is planned but not set up yet. To switch: set
`site: 'https://golf.mardr.com'`, remove `base` from `astro.config.mjs`, re-add `public/CNAME`
containing `golf.mardr.com`, and add a Namecheap DNS record (`golf` CNAME → `mmarder.github.io`).
`withBase()` makes the link changes automatic.
**Repo:** https://github.com/mmarder/golfbuddy
**Data store:** None. Fully static. The only per-device state is the Daily Drills checklist, stored
in the browser's `localStorage` under key `golfbuddy.drills` (functional state only — no PII).
**Error tracking:** None.

**Routes:** `/`, `/drills/`, `/fundamentals/`, `/long-game/`, `/short-game/`, `/putting/`.

**Active branches:**
- `main` — production

> **Stale-data guard:** Astro 7 uses the Content Layer API (loaders in `astro/loaders`) and Tailwind

## 4. Data Model

No database. Content is authored as files validated at build time:

- **`areas`** collection — markdown files in `src/content/areas/`, entry id = filename slug
  (`fundamentals`, `long-game`, `short-game`, `putting`). Frontmatter: `title`, `summary`, `icon`,
  `order`. Body is markdown. Ordered by `order` on the home hub (Fundamentals=1, Long Game=2,
  Short Game=3, Putting=4). Content convention: `⚠️ **Watch-out:**` blockquotes flag common errors.
- **`drills`** collection — `src/content/drills.json`, an array of
  `{ id, title, detail?, order, steps? }`. The `id` is the stable key used for checklist
  persistence, so editing/reordering drills does not lose ticked state.
  `steps` (optional) is `{ heading: string; cues: string[] }[]` — when present, a native
  `<details>`/`<summary>` disclosure is rendered as a sibling of the checkbox label inside the
  card, so tapping the summary never toggles the checkbox.

**Per-device state:** `localStorage["golfbuddy.drills"]` holds `{ version: 1, checked: string[] }`
— the ids of ticked drills. Read/written only through `checklist-state.ts` (safe-parse: any
malformed/legacy/wrong-version payload resets to empty). No personal data.

---

## 5. Type System

- Content shapes are defined by Zod schemas in `src/content.config.ts` (the source of truth for
  content). `astro sync` generates types consumed via `astro:content`.
- `ChecklistState` (`src/lib/checklist-state.ts`): `{ checked: string[] }`, with `STORAGE_VERSION`
  and a `Progress` interface `{ done, total, percent }`.

---

## 6. Key Modules & Pure Functions

- **`src/lib/checklist-state.ts`** — the entire testable logic layer, free of DOM/`localStorage`:
  `emptyState`, `reset`, `isChecked`, `toggle` (immutable), `progress` (ignores stale ids, no
  divide-by-zero), `serialize`, `deserialize` (safe-parse). Fully unit-tested (17 cases).
- **`src/components/Checklist.astro`** `<script>` — the only I/O layer: reads/writes `localStorage`
  (wrapped in try/catch for private-mode/disabled), paints the DOM, wires checkbox + reset events.
  All state transitions delegate to the pure module.

---

## 7. Conventions

- **Input validation:** Content validated at build time by content-collection Zod schemas. There are
  no runtime user-input boundaries (static site, no forms/backend).
- **Error handling:** N/A at runtime except `localStorage` access, which is try/catch-wrapped and
  degrades gracefully (UI still works for the session; persistence silently skipped).
- **Safe helpers:** `deserialize()` is the safe-parse boundary for persisted state.
- **Copy tone:** short, plain, encouraging reminders a beginner can scan one-handed at the range.
- **Check command:** `npm run check` → `astro check` (type-check) + `vitest run` + `astro build`.
  Run before every commit.

## 8. Interfaces (API routes / functions / events)

None. Static site — no API routes, functions, or server events. Routes are file-based static pages:
`/`, `/drills/`, `/fundamentals/`, `/long-game/`, `/short-game/`, `/putting/`.

---

## 9. Feature Flags & Kill-switches

None.

---

## 10. Environment Variables

None required (static build, no secrets).

---

## 11. Known Issues

- **Custom domain deferred.** Site currently lives at the project-Pages subpath
  (https://mmarder.github.io/golfbuddy/). Switching to `golf.mardr.com` later is the documented
  change in the Overview section (config `site`/`base`, `public/CNAME`, Namecheap DNS).
- All four practice-area pages now contain real lesson content. Future lessons should be added
  directly to the relevant `src/content/areas/*.md` file.
- Light theme is hardcoded (`data-theme="light"`); no dark-mode toggle yet.
